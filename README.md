# trello-clone

A bare-bones clone of Trello, with drag-and-drop functionality. Coding along to _Fullstack React with Typescript_ with my touches to fix various little bugs. Good intro to a number of libraries, Styled Components and React DnD in particular, and global state management without Redux.

Made with `create-react-app`.
